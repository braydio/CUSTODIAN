# CUSTODIAN Repository Router

This repository contains multiple eras of the project. For all active Godot work under `custodian/`, the mandatory local authority and workflow primer is:

1. `custodian/AGENTS.md`
2. the matching implementation spec under `design/`
3. `custodian/docs/ai_context/CURRENT_STATE.md`

Active Godot feature specifications live under `design/02_features/`. Do not add new work to the retired `design/20_features/` tree. The legacy Python simulation and its AI context are historical reference only.

Repository-root path equivalents used by the local primer are:

- active design: `design/`
- current state/context/index: `custodian/docs/ai_context/`
- active runtime: `custodian/game/`, `custodian/content/`, and `custodian/project.godot`
- validation: `custodian/docs/ai_context/VALIDATION_RECIPES.md` and `custodian/tools/validation/`

If root guidance conflicts with `custodian/AGENTS.md` for Godot runtime work, follow `custodian/AGENTS.md`.

For long-horizon wanted-feature tracking, use `design/90_codex/` and its tracker at `design/90_codex/TRACKER.md`; codex cards are idea inventory until graduated into active design authority.
