## First: lock the *ontological truth* of the universe

Before guilds, before contracts-as-social-fiction, before recon mechanics, you need to answer one question:

> **Who asserts that a campaign exists?**

Not who *offers* it.
Who asserts its **reality**.

There are only three coherent answers.

---

## Option A — External Authority (Guild / Faction / Network)

**Model**

* Campaigns are “contracts” issued by an external organization.
* Recon is intelligence gathering.
* Rewards are payments / access / favors.

**What this implies**

* You are not alone.
* The universe still has institutions.
* Knowledge is transactional.
* The hub is an outpost or terminal node.

**What this breaks**

* Your terminal-first austerity
* The “final custodian” tone
* The sense of epistemic decay

This model tends to drift toward:

> “mission select screen with lore”

It is coherent, but it is **not aligned** with your current architecture or tone.

---

## Option B — Autonomous Universe (Signals, Drift, Residual Systems)

**Model**

* Campaigns are *detected*, not offered.
* Recon is signal interpretation.
* Rewards are recovered truths.
* No one is assigning you tasks.

**What this implies**

* The universe still *moves*, but blindly.
* Campaign worlds exist whether you go or not.
* You are reacting to entropy.

This aligns better, but still has a problem:

> Who decides *which* campaigns are actionable?

You still need a selector.

---

## Option C — The Custodian As the Selector (Correct for You)

This is the one your docs already imply.

### Canonical truth (reconciled)

> **Campaigns are contracts as an interface, not as a social fiction.**

The Custodian is:

* alone
* institutional memory
* archivist, not agent
* trying to keep the universe *legible*

Campaigns are not “jobs”.
They are **self-authored operational commitments**.

---

## Lock this in (this matters)

### The hub is **not** a place of commerce or coordination.

The hub is:

> A persistent operational archive
> where the Custodian decides
> *what is worth knowing next*.

You are not staying sane by “staying busy”.
You are staying sane by **maintaining coherence**.

That’s the tone you’re circling.

---

## Now: what is the hub *mechanically*?

Strip away narrative for a second.

### The hub is a **knowledge state machine**.

It tracks:

```text
- What is known
- What is suspected
- What is irretrievably lost
- What patterns appear to repeat
```

Not power. Not resources. Not currency.

Those “persistent bonuses” are not buffs.
They are **interpretive leverage** that unlocks capability and choice.

---

## What does a successful campaign actually return?

You said it correctly already:

> artifact, knowledge, schematic, lost tech

But those are *surface forms*.

Mechanically, every campaign returns one of two things:

### 1. A **Concrete Recovery**

* A device
* A process
* A material fact

### 2. A **Contextual Revelation**

* Who made it
* Why it exists
* What came before / after
* Whether it was understood by those who used it

These two together form a **Hub Knowledge Node**.

---

## Hub Knowledge Nodes (this is the real currency)

Think in terms of nodes, not items.

```python
KnowledgeNode:
  category        # biotech, propulsion, governance, cognition, warfare
  origin          # civilization / era / unknown
  confidence      # inferred, partial, confirmed
  implications    # what this recontextualizes
```

This is how:

> “How long has it been there?”
> “Is that a long time compared to others?”

…becomes mechanically meaningful.

Time is *relative* across campaign worlds.
The hub is the only place where **comparative time exists**.

---

## So how do campaign offers actually appear?

Not as offers from people.

### Campaigns are **structured scenario proposals**

Each campaign proposal is:

> A generated scenario bundle
> surfaced by the hub
> to resolve a gap in understanding.

Example (not text, but structure):

```text
KNOWN:
- Multiple worlds show evidence of rapid genetic divergence.
UNKNOWN:
- Whether divergence was intentional or environmental.
HYPOTHESIS:
- A shared biotech precursor may exist.
```

That hypothesis spawns **campaign archetypes**.

---

## Campaign archetypes (important)

These are *not* locations.
They are **investigative shapes**.

Examples:

* **Recovery**: something intact exists
* **Excavation**: fragments remain
* **Containment**: something is still active
* **Observation**: the system is ongoing
* **Interdiction**: prevent further loss

Each archetype constrains:

* sector layout tendencies
* threat behavior
* failure consequences
* reward types

This is where procedural generation lives safely.

---

## What is recon, then?

Recon is **hub-side refinement**, not scouting.

Recon does **not** happen in campaign worlds.
It happens in the hub as a scenario refinement pass.

Recon answers:

* How confident is this hypothesis?
* What kind of failure is likely?
* What kind of knowledge is at stake?

Mechanically, recon:

```text
- Narrows unknown ranges
- Reveals one categorical truth
- Reduces surprise, not danger
```

Recon never guarantees safety.
It only reduces *misinterpretation*.

---

## “How can a campaign mutate the hub if we don’t know what it is?”

This is the core question — and the answer is the heart of the game.

### You never fully know.

Campaign outcomes mutate the hub in **three ways**, regardless of success:

1. **Add knowledge**
2. **Invalidate hypotheses**
3. **Mark irretrievable loss**

Even a failure tells you something *can no longer be known*.

That’s why archive loss is existential.

---

## Persistent bonuses reframed correctly

Those “bonuses” are not:

* damage boosts
* survival buffs
* power scaling

They are things like:

* improved classification
* earlier recognition of patterns
* reduced ambiguity in future STATUS reports
* access to new archetypes of questions

In other words:

> The universe becomes more legible, not safer.

---

## Answering your direct questions cleanly

> **How do we get campaign offers?**

The hub surfaces **scenario proposals** based on gaps in accumulated knowledge.

> **Is the hub world populated?**

No. Presence undermines the premise.
Any “voices” should be residual systems, not actors.

> **Are we alone?**

Yes — functionally and institutionally.
That loneliness is not narrative flavor; it is a design constraint.

> **Is recon autonomous or gameplay?**

Recon is a **hub action** that trades *time / attention* for *clarity*.
It refines categories, not stats.

> **How do we know outcomes before doing the campaign?**

You don’t.
You only know **what kind of truth is at stake**.

---

## The key lock-in (write this somewhere)

> CUSTODIAN is not about winning campaigns.
> It is about deciding **what must be known before it disappears forever**.

Everything you’ve built so far supports this.
Nothing needs to be undone.

---

## What to do next (still scaffolding)

If you want the *right* next step, it is not implementation.

It is to write **one short spec**:

> **Hub Knowledge Model & Campaign Hypothesis Spec**

That doc should define:

* KnowledgeNode types
* Hypothesis generation rules
* Archetype list (small)
* What recon can and cannot reveal

No prose. No lore. Just structure.

If you want, I can draft that spec cleanly next.
