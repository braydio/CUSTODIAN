# Roadmap

This roadmap tracks implementation-facing priorities.

## Completed Baseline

- Backend-authoritative terminal command loop.
- Shared `/command` contract across UI/world-state servers.
- Spatial assaults with approach traversal and tactical resolution.
- Presence/authority split with transit movement.
- Policy/doctrine/allocation/fabrication layers.
- Comms fidelity-driven information degradation.

## Current Workstreams

1. Balance and pacing
- Tune threat, assaults, interception, and material economy.

2. UX readability
- Improve operator output clarity while preserving terse diegetic tone.

3. Test depth
- Expand deterministic integration coverage for long-run world interactions.

4. Snapshot stability
- Keep snapshot fields stable for terminal-side projection modules.

## Deferred

- Hub/campaign progression systems beyond current scaffolding.
- Presentation-layer experiments that preserve backend authority.
