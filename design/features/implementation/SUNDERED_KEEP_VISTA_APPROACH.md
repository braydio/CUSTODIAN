# Sundered Keep Vista Approach

- **Status:** complete, smoke-validated, and source-asset audited
- **Owner:** rendering / camera
- **Runtime:** `custodian/` Godot 4.x
- **Generator:** `custodian/tools/build_sundered_keep_approach_blockout.gd`
- **Director:** `custodian/scripts/levels/sundered_keep/overlook_camera_director.gd`
- **Generated scene:** `custodian/scenes/levels/sundered_keep/sundered_keep_approach_blockout.tscn`

## Summary

A visual-only camera/composition sequence for the Sundered Keep approach. The player enters from mainland top-down, climbs a hill as the horizon reveals the Sundered Keep vista, traverses laterally along a cliff face (occluding the vista), then returns to normal top-down play.

**Hard constraint:** Rendering/camera only. No navigation, combat, enemy AI, or deterministic simulation state. Collision stays on existing `StaticBody2D` + `CollisionPolygon2D` polygons. Runtime visuals are authored `Sprite2D` matte/terrain assets; polygons remain as collision authority only. Sprite2D assets are fit to their target `Rect2` as a builder-side safety net, but production source PNGs must still export at the documented dimensions. Playable terrain art must keep transparent pixels outside the authored terrain shape unless the full rectangle is intentionally terrain.

## Runtime Ingress Chain

Normal contract-world access now routes through:

```
Procgen world placement -> WorldIngressSite -> authored Sundered Keep approach/vista -> final fade -> SunderedKeepMap
```

`ContractWorldLoader` owns placement of the procgen-side `WorldIngressSite`. `res://game/world/approaches/sundered_keep/sundered_keep_approach.tscn` owns the authored reveal/vista/fade approach using the transparent path, underlay, and occlusion Sprite2D assets under `res://content/sprites/world/return_causeway/`. The runtime approach isolates presentation from the generated world: `WorldIngressSite` hides and disables `ProcGenRuntime` and `ConnectedMaps` while the approach is active, the approach scene draws an opaque dark backdrop, and `sundered_keep_approach.gd` fits all path/fog/occlusion sprites to explicit design `Rect2`s instead of using raw PNG dimensions. Path sprites render below the Operator, occluders start hidden, and route blockers default disabled while the layout is still being tuned; the live walkable rectangles are metadata-only `Area2D` nodes with no collision. `res://game/world/sundered_keep/sundered_keep_map.gd` remains the real gameplay destination after the fade. The old direct `SunderedKeepTravelGate` path is retained only behind `place_debug_sundered_keep_gateway` for review.

## Scene Architecture

```
SunderedKeepApproach
├── UnderlayRoot          z=-300  — always-visible ocean/cliff/fog mattes
├── VistaRoot             z=-200  — alpha-faded horizon layers (modulate.a driven by director)
│   └── VistaFogBand      Node2D parent so director alpha-fades left+right together
├── PlayableRoot          z=0     — walkable path Sprite2D + collision StaticBody2D
├── OcclusionRoot         z=100   — alpha-faded blocking layers (modulate.a driven by director)
├── Markers               — Marker2D waypoints for camera director
├── Operator              — instanced from operator.tscn at MainlandStart
├── Camera2D              — active game camera
└── OverlookCameraDirector — drives camera offset/zoom + vista/occlusion/fog alpha from player position vs markers
```

### Z-order

| Root | z_index | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| UnderlayRoot | -300 | Behind everything |
| VistaRoot | -200 | Horizon sky, far sea, distant keep, fog band |
| PlayableRoot | 0 | Walkable terrain with collision |
| Operator | 50 | Player character |
| OcclusionRoot | 100 | Cliff/wall occluders that hide vista during traverse |
| Camera/Director | — | No visual concern |

The builder writes these visual roots and the Operator with `z_as_relative=false` so draw order does not depend on scene-tree insertion or inherited z values.

### Camera states & markers

State transitions are driven by player position against Marker2D waypoints. Approach flows **north (decreasing Y)** then **east (increasing X)**.

| State | Camera offset/zoom | Vista alpha | Occlusion alpha | Trigger marker |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Mainland Topdown | normal_offset (0,0), normal_zoom (1,1) | 0.0 | 0.0 | Player starts at MainlandStart (y≈430) |
| 2 — Hill Reveal Blend | reveal_offset (0,-140), reveal_zoom (0.86) | 0→1 smoothstep | 0.0 | Player enters RevealStart (y≈80) to RevealFull (y≈-250) |
| 3 — Overlook Vista | reveal_offset, reveal_zoom | 1.0 | 0.0 | Player between RevealFull and TraverseStart |
| 4 — Lateral Traverse | traverse_offset (0,-48), traverse_zoom (0.96) | 1→0.35 | 0→1 | Player passes TraverseStart (x≈260) |
| 5 — Return Topdown | normal_offset, normal_zoom | 0.35 (fading) | 1.0 | Player passes TraverseEnd (x≈760) toward ReturnTopdown |

**Marker positions** (from builder):

| Marker | Position |
|--------|----------|
| MainlandStart | `(-80, 430)` |
| RevealStart | `(-40, 80)` |
| RevealFull | `(0, -250)` |
| TraverseStart | `(260, -180)` |
| TraverseEnd | `(760, -170)` |
| ReturnTopdown | `(720, -80)` |

All transitions use `lerp` with `smoothing_speed=5.0`. Fog band starts at `alpha=0.35`.

## Existing Background Assets

The following painterly matte/background assets already exist at `res://content/backgrounds/sundered_keep/`. They are wide single images (not split L/R pairs). Use linear filtering (not nearest-neighbor) on import.

| File | Size | Scene role |
|------|------|------------|
| `ocean_underlay.png` | 2100×1400 | UnderlayRoot — deep ocean below everything |
| `cliff_depth_underlay.png` | 520×540 | UnderlayRoot — dark cliff mass |
| `horizon_sky.png` | 2100×380 | VistaRoot — night/void sky |
| `horizon_sky_02.png` | 2100×380 | VistaRoot — sky variant |
| `far_sea.png` | 2100×260 | VistaRoot — dark sea band on horizon |
| `far_sea_02.png` | 2100×260 | VistaRoot — sea variant |
| `distant_sundered_keep.png` | 540×250 | VistaRoot — keep silhouette on horizon |
| `vista_fog_band.png` | 2100×160 | VistaRoot/VistaFogBand — seam-hiding fog |
| `keep_horizon_wide.png` | 1689×787 | Reserve — wider keep matte if needed |

These live under `content/` not `assets/`. Use `res://content/backgrounds/sundered_keep/` paths.

## Asset Export Contract

The generated scene uses top-left anchored `Sprite2D` nodes (`centered=false`) and scales each texture to its intended world `Rect2`. This protects runtime layout if a source image drifts, but size drift still emits a warning and should be fixed at the source.

Run the source audit before accepting visual changes:

```bash
cd custodian
python3 tools/validation/sundered_keep_approach_asset_audit.py
```

The audit checks all approach PNG dimensions and fails if any PlayableRoot terrain asset has no alpha channel or is fully opaque. PlayableRoot PNGs should generally be transparent outside the visible path/terrain silhouette so the editor/game view does not show stacked rectangular plates.

The live ingress approach has a separate runtime fitting table in `res://game/world/approaches/sundered_keep/sundered_keep_approach.gd`. It intentionally scales `res://content/sprites/world/return_causeway/` path/underlay/occlusion PNGs into target world rectangles, including a thin `2100x130` `WallShadowOccluder`, so oversized generated overlay exports cannot appear as raw black curtains over the scene.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 — Add `_sprite_rect()` helper to builder

In `custodian/tools/build_sundered_keep_approach_blockout.gd`, add a helper that creates a `Sprite2D` with centered=false, positioned at rect top-left, loading the texture, scaling it to the requested `Rect2.size`, and warning if missing or size-mismatched. Then rewrite `_build_underlay()`, `_build_playable()`, `_build_vista()`, `_build_occlusion()` to emit `Sprite2D` nodes instead of visible `Polygon2D` placeholders.

**Helper pattern:**
```gdscript
func _sprite_rect(parent: Node2D, owner: Node, name: String, texture_path: String, rect: Rect2, z_index := 0) -> Sprite2D:
    var sprite := Sprite2D.new()
    sprite.name = name
    sprite.centered = false
    sprite.position = rect.position
    sprite.z_index = z_index
    var texture := load(texture_path) as Texture2D
    if texture == null:
        push_warning("Missing approach texture for %s: %s" % [name, texture_path])
    else:
        sprite.texture = texture
        var actual := Vector2i(texture.get_width(), texture.get_height())
        var expected := Vector2i(int(rect.size.x), int(rect.size.y))
        if actual.x > 0 and actual.y > 0:
            sprite.scale = Vector2(rect.size.x / float(actual.x), rect.size.y / float(actual.y))
        if actual != expected:
            push_warning("Size mismatch for %s: expected %s, got %s; scaling to fit Rect2." % [name, str(expected), str(actual)])
    parent.add_child(sprite)
    sprite.owner = owner
    return sprite
```

### Phase 2 — Replace UnderlayRoot Polygon2D with Sprite2D

Current `_build_underlay()` creates three visible `Polygon2D` nodes (`OceanUnderlay`, `CliffDepthUnderlay`, `FogUnderlay`). Replace them with `_sprite_rect()` calls. **Remove the visible Polygon2D creation; keep no visual polygons.** The collision is in PlayableRoot only — underlay has no collision.

| Sprite name | Asset path | Rect position & size | z_index |
|---|---|---|---|
| OceanUnderlay | `res://content/backgrounds/sundered_keep/ocean_underlay.png` | `Rect2(-900, -700, 2100, 1400)` | 0 |
| CliffDepthUnderlay | `res://content/backgrounds/sundered_keep/cliff_depth_underlay.png` | `Rect2(-500, -440, 520, 540)` | 1 |
| FogUnderlay | `res://content/backgrounds/sundered_keep/approach/playable/underlay_fog_band.png` | `Rect2(-900, -620, 2172, 724)` | 2 |

Use `z_index` within UnderlayRoot to establish draw order: ocean (0), cliff (1), fog (2).

### Phase 3 — Replace PlayableRoot Polygon2D with Sprite2D + keep collision

Current `_build_playable()` creates five visible `Polygon2D` nodes then calls `_add_collision_polygon()` for four of them. **Replace the Polygon2D nodes with Sprite2D. Keep all `_add_collision_polygon()` calls unchanged.** Collision polygons stay as the sole collision authority.

PlayableRoot now uses all authored Sprite2D art. Collision polygons remain on StaticBody2D unchanged.

| Sprite name | Asset path | Rect | z_index |
|---|---|---|---|
| MainlandApproachPath | `res://content/backgrounds/sundered_keep/approach/playable/mainland_approach_path.png` | `Rect2(-300, 120, 470, 400)` | 0 |
| HillClimbPath | `res://content/backgrounds/sundered_keep/approach/playable/hill_climb_path.png` | `Rect2(-190, -120, 400, 240)` | 1 |
| OverlookLedge | `res://content/backgrounds/sundered_keep/approach/playable/overlook_ledge.png` | `Rect2(-320, -320, 640, 240)` | 2 |
| LateralTraversePath | `res://content/backgrounds/sundered_keep/approach/playable/lateral_traverse_path.png` | `Rect2(260, -260, 520, 180)` | 3 |
| FortressWallMass | `res://content/backgrounds/sundered_keep/approach/playable/fortress_wall_mass.png` | `Rect2(650, -420, 360, 380)` | 10 |

All five playable sprites exist and are wired as Sprite2D.

### Phase 4 — Replace VistaRoot Polygon2D with Sprite2D

Current `_build_vista()` creates four visible Polygon2D nodes (`HorizonSky`, `FarSea`, `DistantSunderedKeep`, `VistaFogBand`). Replace with `_sprite_rect()`. Preserve `parent.modulate.a = 0.0` (starts hidden, director fades in).

The VistaFogBand should remain a single `Sprite2D` named `VistaFogBand` so the director's `fog_band` export reference (pointing at `VistaRoot/VistaFogBand`) continues to work without changes.

| Sprite name | Asset path | Rect | z_index |
|---|---|---|---|
| HorizonSky | `res://content/backgrounds/sundered_keep/horizon_sky.png` | `Rect2(-900, -700, 2100, 380)` | 0 |
| FarSea | `res://content/backgrounds/sundered_keep/far_sea.png` | `Rect2(-900, -520, 2100, 260)` | 1 |
| DistantSunderedKeep | `res://content/backgrounds/sundered_keep/distant_sundered_keep.png` | `Rect2(-260, -670, 540, 250)` | 2 |
| VistaFogBand | `res://content/backgrounds/sundered_keep/vista_fog_band.png` | `Rect2(-900, -380, 2100, 160)` | 3 |

### Phase 5 — Replace OcclusionRoot Polygon2D with Sprite2D

Current `_build_occlusion()` creates two visible Polygon2D nodes (`CliffOccluder`, `WallShadowOccluder`). Replace with `_sprite_rect()`. Preserve `parent.modulate.a = 0.0` (starts hidden, director fades in during traverse).

Both occluder sprites now exist under `approach/playable/` and are wired as Sprite2D.

| Sprite name | Asset path | Rect | z_index |
|---|---|---|---|
| CliffOccluder | `res://content/backgrounds/sundered_keep/approach/playable/cliff_occluder.png` | `Rect2(520, -420, 520, 540)` | 0 |
| WallShadowOccluder | `res://content/backgrounds/sundered_keep/approach/playable/wall_shadow_occluder.png` | `Rect2(-900, -360, 2100, 130)` | 1 |

### Phase 6 — Regenerate the scene

```bash
cd custodian
godot --headless --path . --script res://tools/build_sundered_keep_approach_blockout.gd
```

Expected output: `Generated: res://scenes/levels/sundered_keep/sundered_keep_approach_blockout.tscn`

After regeneration, open the scene in the editor and verify the node tree matches expectations.

### Phase 7 — Add validation smoke test

Create `custodian/tools/validation/sundered_keep_approach_render_smoke.gd`.

Checks:
- Packed scene loads successfully
- All expected Sprite2D nodes exist per root (UnderlayRoot, PlayableRoot, VistaRoot, OcclusionRoot)
- Each Sprite2D has a non-null texture
- Each Sprite2D position matches its expected `Rect2.position`
- Each Sprite2D texture size multiplied by scale matches its expected `Rect2.size`
- `Operator` node exists
- `Camera2D` node exists
- `OverlookCameraDirector` node exists with wired exports: `player`, `camera`, `vista_root`, `occlusion_root`, `fog_band`

Run:
```bash
cd custodian
godot --headless --path . --script res://tools/validation/sundered_keep_approach_render_smoke.gd
```

### Phase 8 — Wire into playable acceptance

Open the generated scene in Godot editor:
```bash
godot --path custodian/scenes/levels/sundered_keep/sundered_keep_approach_blockout.tscn
```

Enable Camera2D and walk the Operator through all four camera states:
```
MainlandStart → RevealStart → RevealFull → TraverseStart → TraverseEnd → ReturnTopdown
```

Verify at each state:
- Camera offset/zoom transitions smoothly
- Vista alpha fades in correctly during hill reveal
- Occlusion fades in during lateral traverse
- Fog band alpha blends correctly
- Collision prevents walking off the path
- No rendering artifacts or missing textures

## Constraints

1. **Rendering/camera only.** No collision, navigation, combat, enemy AI, or simulation state.
2. **Collision stays on existing StaticBody2D polygons.** Visual Sprite2D replacements must not add or alter collision.
3. **Approach flows north (negative Y) then east (positive X).** The director and markers assume this orientation.
4. **The builder is the source of truth.** Edit `build_sundered_keep_approach_blockout.gd`, not the `.tscn` directly. Regenerate after changes.
5. **The director expects `VistaRoot/VistaFogBand` to exist** as a single node it can alpha-fade via the `fog_band` export.
6. **Imported background assets should use linear filtering** (not nearest-neighbor) since they are painterly mattes, not pixel tiles.
7. **Scene is connected to the main game flow via F6 key** in `debug_bus.gd`. Pressing F6 in the main game changes to the approach blockout scene.

## Next Agent Slice

- **Goal:** All phases complete. No remaining implementation work.
- **Future opportunities:**
  - In-editor visual review of the approach blockout scene (open `sundered_keep_approach_blockout.tscn` and walk the operator)
  - In-editor visual review of the procgen ingress -> `sundered_keep_approach.tscn` -> `SunderedKeepMap` flow
  - Replace the current ingress tile fallback with a specific coast/keep ingress reservation in the procgen intent graph
  - Ensure the approach transitions smoothly back to the main game scene after completion
- **Constraint:** Rendering-only. No collision changes. No combat/nav/AI.
